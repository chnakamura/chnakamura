### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Chris!

#### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
 
[NurseScheduler](https://github.com/chnakamura/NurseScheduler) Nurse scheduling is a significant pain-point for hospitals. This project implements a generic two-phase stochastic variable neighborhood algorithm developed by researchers at the University of Western Greece to find a near-optimal solution in quadratic time.
- I welcome you to fork the repo and try modifying the cost function! I think we could find some interesting results!

#### I have previously worked on

[Covid Tracker Tracker](http://covid-tracker-tracker.chrisnakamura.com) A webapp that tracks how many COVID-19 trackers that are public on Github. 
- A serverless React.js app deployed using AWS S3, API Gateway and Lambda. 
- Uses AWS EventBridge and Lambda to query the Github API once per day, caching the results in a DynamoDB database in order to display results quickly and avoid rate-limiting. 

[PicQuery](https://github.com/chnakamura/picquery) A webapp that stores and automatically tags users photos for their contents using machine learning with Amazonâ€™s Rekognition engine.

[StegChris](https://github.com/chnakamura/stegchris) While I had heard about sternography before this project, I never actually learned how it worked. I decided to challenge myself by making a sternography engine without doing any research about the best practices for implementing sternography.
